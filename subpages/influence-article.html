                        As everything else goes, doing something excessively can have negative effects on our lives. Social media isn’t excluded from this rule. It’s a part of millions', if not billions' of people’s everyday lives and some tend to be affected by it more than others.
                    </p>
                    <div class="article-content">
                        <h1 class="article-subtitle">Wasting time…precious time </h1>
                        <p class="article-text">
                            There’s a small chance any of us hasn’t picked up their phone when they found themselves in a boring situation. You know how it goes. Scrolling with no purpose in mind is the modern man’s leisure activity of choice.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-text">
                            Doing something productive all the time isn’t a necessity; it may not even be healthy. Although, even substituting a fraction of scrolling time with a small chore that we’ve been putting off or a hobby could improve our mood. Maybe even having a real-life conversation with someone!
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="article-subtitle">Sharing too much?</h1>
                        <p class ="article-text">
                            Sharing too much information, especially on a public medium like the internet can become a dangerous activity. Publishing private details about your life can become a dangerous activity considering how easy it is to access it. Nobody wants to be stalked or have someone show up in front of their house in the middle of the night.

                            A lot of the times people tend to compare themselves to others. It’s in the human nature to do so. Different people have different lives, though, and sometimes those can’t be compared. A rockstar or a supermodel who posts daily on their social media accounts have way more going on in their lives then the publics normally gets to see.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-text">
                            And so, someone sees these people’s lives only through their posts. When they go back to their normal, not so extreme life, they may feel like they’re not trying hard enough. Some even think that their life has no meaning. That’s not the case though. We can have fulfilling lives without being famous.

                            Your phone may be your best friend, but that doesn’t mean you need to go to bed with it. Using our phones before going to sleep has a big impact on how well we sleep during the night. The light from the device suppresses the hormone that makes us feel tired.

                                <li>Read a book before going to sleep</li>

                        <p class="article-text">Social media has its perks, besides the negative influence. Watching some funny cat video can really improve your mood if you’re feeling sad that day. Getting in touch with people is so much easier. You don’t have to bike half an hour in the rain to ask your friend how to turn on the toy they have gifted you recently.</p>
